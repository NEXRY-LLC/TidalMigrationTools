Firstly, I want to acknowledge the transition that has taken place following Redwood’s acquisition of TIDAL. For over two decades, our partnership with TIDAL has been integral to our operations and combined success, and we have deeply valued this relationship.
In light of the recent acquisition, we understand that changes are to be expected as Redwood integrates TIDAL into its business model. However, we have noticed that the current reseller contract does not clearly outline the prospects for a long-term partnership. The absence of a defined reseller model from Redwood has introduced a level of uncertainty for us, especially after experiencing a reduction in profit margins this year, which has notably affected our revenue.
Given these circumstances, we find ourselves at a crossroads where it is imperative to diversify our partnerships to maintain stability and growth for our company. This decision is born out of a need to ensure business continuity and not from a lack of faith in the quality and potential of the products now under Redwood.
Given the current climate and the recent changes in our agreement, we are exploring relationships with other vendors who have established supportive reseller models. This strategic move is not a reflection of the quality or value we see in Redwood's offerings but a necessary step to ensure the resilience and sustainability of our business in the face of new market realities.
We are still committed to finding a way forward that continues to benefit both our company and Redwood. We believe that through open dialogue, we can discuss potential adjustments or accommodations that may encourage a more definitive long-term partnership.
Please understand, our intention is to uphold the valuable relationship we have cherished with TIDAL and, by extension, with Redwood. We believe in open communication and would like to explore how we might navigate this new landscape together.
We are committed to finding a way forward that continues to benefit both parties. To that end, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how we might align our business strategies to support mutual growth and success in the long term.
Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? Your insights and support are crucial to us as we adapt to these changes.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am looking forward to a constructive dialogue and am hopeful for what our continued collaboration can achieve.
