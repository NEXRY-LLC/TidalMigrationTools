JUST SOME NOTES CONCERNING THE CFNA MIGRATION TO OPEN SYSTEMS

INVOKE 'SWS.ESP.APPL.PROCLIB(#DISTRIB)'
NOTIFY FAILURE ABEND MAILBOX(CFNABAOP)

10/04/2016- CHANGED THE JOB NAMES IN ALL OF THE APPLS TO REMOVE THE CR_
            PREFIX.  I ORIGINALLY PUT THIS IN THERE TO SIGNIFY THAT THE
            THIS WAS A CALL REST SCRIPT.  IT WAS SUPERFLUOUS.

SPOKE WITH DEVELOPERS TO ELIMINATE THE ESP PROCESS OF SCRAPING THE PID#
      FROM THE MAINFRAME LOG.  THIS IS NOT A VERY ELEGANT OR RELIABLE
      SOLUTION.  THIS SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS A SECOND OR THIRD COMMAND
      EMBEDDED IN THEIR SCRIPT.  WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

I ALSO PLAN ON MOVING ALL THESE MEMBERS TO OUR NORMAL APPL.PROCLIB DSN.
      WE SET THIS RT02 DATASET UP SO DEVELOPERS COULD SEE EDIT THEIR
      OWN APPLS.  BUT THANKFULLY THAT NEVER CAME TO LIGHT. NO LONGER
      AN ISSUE.  EVERYTHING WILL BE MOVED SOON.

NAMING THE APPLS IS ANOTHER THING I AM WORKING ON.  CURRENT STANDARDS
  WERE SET UP AT THE BEGINNING BUT DON'T QUITE WORK FOR US RIGHT NOW.
  I WILL KEEP THE CF IN PLACE, BUT REWORK THE REST OF THE STANDARDS ONCE
  I HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING WITH THEIR JOBS.

AGENTS - AS OF 10/05/2016 THERE ARE 4 AGENTS -
         2 DEVELOPMENT BOXES AND 2 STAGING BOXES - I IMAGINE THEY WILL
   HAVE AT LEAST 2 PRODUCTION BOXES AS WELL.


IDEAS - CFNITE01-CFNITE99 = NIGHTLY PROCESSING APPLS
        CFMCYC05-CFMCYC30 = MONTHLY CYCLE APPLICATIONS
        CFMLPF05-CFMLPF30 = MONTHLY LATE PAYMENT FEE APPLICATIONS


DATES - RUN DATES AND "RUN AS" DATES ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT VARIABLES.
        RUN DATES WILL REPRESENT THE DATES THE JOBS/APPLS RUN
        "RUN AS" DATES WILL BE FOR CYCLE PROCESSING. THESE ARE THE DATES
        WE'LL PASS ALONG AS ARGUMENTS.

        THESE "RUN AS" DATES SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO DATE MEMBERS SO WE
        DONT HAVE TO EDIT THE ACTUAL APPL.
